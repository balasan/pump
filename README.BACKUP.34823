///
install nodejs 0.4.12
///

*the unstable version 0.5.xx will not work!
*best to install without using sudo
see: https://gist.github.com/579814

if you use github to get node, after cloning, do
git checkout v0.4.12
in terminal

///
install npm tools
instal mongodb 0.2.0
///

///
edit git exclude setup
///

after you checkout the pump code from github:
in the project directory, go to .git/info/exclude
and add 
node_modules/*
on the bottom line 
we want to ignore this directory during checkin/outs since we will use npm to install all the modules - they might be slightly different depending on nodejs setup

to install all the necessary modules, in termina, in project directory enter:
npm install -d
(this will install all the dependencies)

last thing!

///
Ždit /etc/hosts file
in terminal, inter 
sudo vi /etc/hosts

press 'i' to edit

on the bottom line add
127.0.0.1 gifpumper.net

then 'esc' then 'wq'

we need to do this the address gifpumper.net is redirected to the localhost 
this is for the cookies/login to work

thats it!

in the project directory enter 
sudo node app.js

oh yeah, you also need to make sure mongodb is running and call some function to populate the database:

first go to gifpumper.net running the browser. go to the chrome debugger and in the console, enter:
ajax.ajaxFunction('refresh')
this will fill out the pages
after that you might have to restart the server again
you can then you can register as a new user

after that you should be able to edit pages, profile etc
thats it!
